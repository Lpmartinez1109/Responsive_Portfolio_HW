# First Steps

After creating the index.html, contact.html and portfolio.html files, I started working on the index html file. I started searching Navbars on Bootstrap and managed to locate one that I believed would work in setting up the page. However, the links were on the wrong side and when edits were made to move them to the right positions, the entire structure would become undone.

The following attempt, I tried to use rows and columns in order to make move the links and the nav bar header move to the appropriate positions.

This did not work either as I was unable to move the navbar and links to their proper places. I ended up removing the div row and column classes. Once they were removed from the code, the padding and margin issues I was encountering were gone.

My next move was to create the base of the other html files. The goal was to at least have the structure down on the files so that I would just have to work on the final details on each of the html files.

# Following Steps

The next steps were to figure out how to fix the issues regarding the navbar. While on the website, the navbar appeared to be function properly, when the screen changed its size, the navbar was thrown out of proportions. After looking at the code, the best step was to use div.row and coloumns to not only ensure that the navbar would respond properly when on a small screen, but it also moved the links and the header into the proper place. 

I had to play around with adjusting the amount of columns on the row before settling on a 2-2-4-4 selecion that placed the header to where I needed it to be.

Once the navbar was fixed, it was copied and pasted to both the portfolio.html and contact.html files. Working on the contact.html was relatively simple. After playing around with some of the code and adding in the text that I need to use, I place it all inside of a container div, and set it to the proper width. After testing how the screen looks at different sizes, I moved on to the portfolio.html file.

The issue this time around was being able to get the text on the images, which proved to be diffcult. While the first two texts were able to be added without issue, it caused a lot of trouble with the following three images and threw off the whole page when I was testing the different screen sizes.
