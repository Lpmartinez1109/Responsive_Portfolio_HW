# Responsive_Portfolio_HW


# First Steps

After creating the index.html, contact.html and portfolio.html files, I started working on the index html file. I started searching Navbars on Bootstrap and managed to locate one that I believed would work in setting up the page. However, the links were on the wrong side and when edits were made to move them to the right positions, the entire structure would become undone.

The following attempt, I tried to use rows and columns in order to make move the links and the nav bar header move to the appropriate positions.

This did not work either as I was unable to move the navbar and links to their proper places. I ended up removing the div row and column classes. Once they were removed from the code, the padding and margin issues I was encountering were gone.

My next move was to create the base of the other html files. The goal was to at least have the structure down on the files so that I would just have to work on the final details on each of the html files.
